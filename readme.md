On October 26th, 2018 I purchased the software assets of Full Moon Software.
Full Moon Software used to be known as Crescent Software.  They produced a line
of excellent development libraries for MS-DOS.  The supported environments were
QuickBASIC 4.x, Microsoft Professional Development System v7.x, and Visual 
Basic for DOS.

The idea behind obtaining these products was to release them to the public
domain to ensure that people could still access these things in the future.
While most developers will have no use for these products in a modern 
develoment environment, they still have value as an example of "how it was 
done" back in the heyday of x86 DOS development. 

The software in this repository hasn't been modified from how I received it 
from Ethan Winer, the original author.  While all the source files carry some 
kind of Copyright notice, the software is now in the public domain.

The contents of the installation floppies will be uploaded to the Internet
Archive soon and when the manuals are scanned, they'll be uploaded there
as well.
The original distribution disk file is available here:

About Crescent Software:
After 20 years as a professional recording engineer and musician, Ethan
Winer founded Crescent Software in 1986, quickly building it to become the
leading provider of add-on products for use with Microsoft compiled BASIC
for DOS. During that time Ethan wrote numerous articles about DOS BASIC and
assembly language for all of the major programming magazines, and also
served as a contributing editor for PC Magazine. Ethan also received
Microsoft's MVP award every year since 1996 for his assistance in the
Microsoft BASIC programming newsgroups. In 1992 Ethan sold Crescent to his
partner Don Malin, and retired in order to pursue his musical interests.

Here's the Quick Menu description from the manual:

QuickMenu is designed to simplify and speed up the process
required by DOS to access programs, DOS commands and other
utilities.  It is recommended for users who have hard disks and
several applications programs that they use at least occasionally.
QuickMenu provides the operator with a menu (or several menus,
as necessary) from which to select these programs.

This eliminates the need to remember which subdirectory each 
program resides in and its DOS file name.  With minimal
knowledge about running programs, an inexperienced user can
set up a system that is appropriate for his or her own needs.
