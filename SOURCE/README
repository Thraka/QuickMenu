Note

Version 3.2 of QMENU.BAS and QMRT.BAS have been revised to be compatible with
both QuickBASIC 4.5 and BASIC 7 PDS.  To Recompile QuickMenu or QMRT, you must
have Crescent Softwares QuickPak Professional for your compiler.

We have included sample response files for BASIC 7 use only.  Also included
is the Logo file for use with QMRT, to reduce the amount of startup memory
needed when running.

Please note that QuickMenu is licenced to you for one user only, and that
source code is provided mainly for educational purposes.  If you want to
write your own menu program for distribution, you may use QuickMenu for
inspiration, but not for a starting point.  If you start with QuickMenu
it is our code and must be licenced, no matter how extensive the
modifications may be.  If you start with a blank screen, it's your code.

If you are a developer you may provide your user with a 'canned' menu and
use QMRT.EXE without licencing.  If you need to distribute the QMENU.EXE,
please call for more information.
